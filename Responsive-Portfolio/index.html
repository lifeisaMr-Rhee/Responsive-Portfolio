      <img src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="auth-image" "img-responsive" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Gamer, sports enthusiast, festival hunter and all around 
        genuine human being. Some people like only 1 of those things
        I mentioned and rarely do they usually like all of them.
        I feel like this makes me a highly unique person and one that
        can easily get along with most people no matter what 
        their interest, because I most likely have something 
        in common with them.</p>

      <p>Recently my hobby has been music production and just 
        attending as many festivals and events that I have time 
        for. The production is coming along slowly as there's 
        always a learning curve. I've been interested in genres 
        like hip hop and rock most of my life, but recently 
        electronic music has made me really enjoy life to the 
        fullest.</p>
